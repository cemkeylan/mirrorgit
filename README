Git mirroring script

Setting up a git mirror is hard, especially if you are trying to mirror your repository to Microsoft's Github. Microsoft does not want you to self-host, so they don't present you with any option for mirroring.

These problems may be solved if you use something like a post-receive hook, but not all self-hosted git repositories use vanilla git. This script is intended for solutions that do not give you the access to post-receive hooks, like Gitlab or Gitea.

This shell script:
* Fetches your repositories to a temporary directory
* Pushes them to the mirror repository

Pretty simple.


Usage
-----

sh mirrorgit.sh

The script creates a file on your home directory to save configuration and can be edited in ~/.mirrorgitrc


Dependencies
------------
* Git (obviously)
* SSH keys deployed on the mirror repository
